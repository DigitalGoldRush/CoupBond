## What is CoupBond?

- ### CoupBond is a new type of bond that is issued by a company to raise capital for a project that will have a positive societal impact

- ### The bond is issued in the form of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically as a dNFT (dynamic NFT/ ERC 1155)

- ### Unlike traditional NFTs, which are static and cannot be changed once they are created, dynamic NFTs are designed to be flexible and customizable. This means that the properties or attributes can be altered or updated over time, allowing the token to evolve and change in response to external factors

- ### The dNFT is issued as a bond, which is a debt instrument that represents a loan from the bondholder to the issuer. By investing in a social impact CoupBond, investors can earn a return on their investment while also supporting projects that are designed to improve the lives of people in a particular community or address a specific social or environmental problem

    #### CO_GOV = Governing Token
